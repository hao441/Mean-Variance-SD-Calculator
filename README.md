# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

## Introduction
Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

## Context
This project was developed as part of my FreeCodeAcademy - Data Analysis with Python course. My project was originally developed on replit, you can access it through this link: https://replit.com/@HarrisonO2/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator#mean_var_std.py

## Setup

pip install pytest
python main.py
```
